Reinforcement Learning studies:
Zhu et al. [167] proposed two iterative reinforcement learning algorithms to identify an ideal defense strategy against cyberattacks especially 
when the information about the attackers is unknown or limited. They used Markov chains and stochastic stability in the algorithms by introducing the 
adaptive, robust reinforcement learning capability. They showed that their method can provide the nearly optimal defensive strategy.

Tozer et al. [149] proposed a multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm to minimize the attack surface of a system. They designed a system to 
generate a multi-objective Markov Decision Process using the systemâ€™s components and behaviors to identify optimal policies.
