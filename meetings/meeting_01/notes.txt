IT Sec Group -> EU 5G Project -> develop Sec Solution (Networks like 5G)
Gür: Group Leader
MTD for some 5G Network functions -> PA Target

MTD: no disadvantage for defender with attack surface configuration, no scanning with low-cost effort
more difficult to understand the system

2: change ports for network services
3: when to change it

-> Decision Problem

Rule based approaches, simple or complex rules to make decisions
ML for decisions -> Reinforcement Learning (trial and error)

make a model for the problem
most likely python library for RL

PA Goals: 
-learn MTD, RL
-implement MTD in simulated enviroment with research grade
-test it, investigate overhead -> performance

next meeeting: 
-small presentation, what we found, what would be suitable, what we further look into
-timetable
-repository
-word or latex for PA Report

meeting fixed on Wednesdays, 8:30

surveys & papers for research in MTD from Mr. Gür
